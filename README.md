# NLP-Text-Summarizer



# Project Title: Text Summarizer

## Overview

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of input text. Text summarization is a vital task in natural language processing, and the system developed here is capable of distilling key information from longer documents, making it particularly useful for tasks such as document summarization, news article extraction, and content curation.

## Features

- **Abstractive Summarization:**
  - Utilizes advanced machine learning models to generate summaries that go beyond mere extraction and create abstractions of the original content.

- **Extractive Summarization:**
  - Implements techniques to identify and extract the most important sentences or phrases from the input text.

- **Customization:**
  - Users can choose between abstractive and extractive summarization based on their specific needs.

- **Scalability:**
  - Designed to handle varying lengths of input text, from short paragraphs to longer documents.
